Development and Contributing
============================

As Planned, the project will eventually deprecate libmpv to have its own audio api in nim, which uses
libao and libsndfile and various other libraries (libfdkaac, libmad, libflac..) to have a fully
cross-platform api that can stretch from windows to sun/solaris/illuminos based distrobutions.
