Supported Platforms
-------------------
Ceiling of supportiveness boils down to the usage of audio api used
to play streams,and not because of the application code, thus can be
extended in the future

Supported platforms include but not limited to:
 - Working
  * Windows 7+
  * MacOS
  * Linux 3.2+
  * BSDs

DragonFlyBSD is not currently supported as the standard library is too buggy
for it (as in tty).

Controls
--------
General Controls are using given numbers or characters to select the menu.
where R would return and q would quit out of the application.
and when stream is being played, use p to pause/mute or play.
