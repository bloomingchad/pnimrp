Thoughts and History
--------------------

This project was conceived by a overnight thought about rewriting pmrp,
(parent project) by hand to another langauge, for knowing shell better and
knowing the target language better, which at that time was C.

After Implementing basic menu drawing with selection, which is just caseing,
all without making use of generics. DIffuculty to keep the project cross-platform
(windows to BSD) became hard when project grew complex, making me reconsider the
implementation language.

This Included: (but not limited to)
 - C# (but nobody will install mono (300+mB) of dependencies to get the application)
 - Rust (syntax?)
 - Nim
